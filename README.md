# USE CASES  
<p align="center">
<b>a) The receiving data on deliveries to be made by 1 truck and on sections between warehouses: generating all possible trajectories through sequences of warehouses where deliveries must be made:

![](/diagrams_UC/UC1.svg?raw=true)  
</p>  
<p align="center">
<b>b) Evaluate these trajectories according to the time to complete all deliveries and return to the Matosinhos base warehouse and choose the solution that allows the truck to return sooner:

![](/diagrams_UC/UC2.svg?raw=true)  
</p>  
<p align="center">
<b>c) Increase the dimension of the problem (putting more warehouses to be visited) and verify to what extent it is feasible to proceed in the adopted way (with a generator of all the solutions) by carrying out a study of the complexity of the problem:

![](/diagrams_UC/UC3.svg?raw=true)  
</p>  
<p align="center">
<b>d) Implement heuristics that can quickly generate a solution (not necessarily the best one) and evaluate the quality of these heuristics (for example, deliver to the nearest warehouse; then deliver with greater mass; combine distance for delivery with mass delivered):

![](/diagrams_UC/UC4.svg?raw=true)
